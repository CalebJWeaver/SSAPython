INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING SSA PROGRAM
1. Import your data. The current code is built to import from a Google Sheets, where the X-values are stored in the first column and the Y-values are in the second column.
2. Select an L value. I have personally found 1/4 of the length of the data set to work well, but this will need to be played with
3. Run everything until the grouping, then select the groups based on the lambda values in the graph above.
Note: "objective" methods exist for this process, but I chose not to use them for this project because I found them to still require user intervention and more trouble than they are worth.
4. Run the rest of the code as normal. You will most likely need to play around with the value of L a few times.
