Q. What is this and why did you make it
A. This is a program to perform SSA analysis on a dataset. I created it as part of the FUTURE Sensors REU at Louisiana Tech University under NSF Grant 2217824 with the guidance of Dr. Xiyuan Liu.

Q. Will you update this code if XYZ
A. If I get time during the school year then yes, but this is not a priority

Q. Would you be willing/able to port this to work in other languages
A. ... I barely understand Python

Q. Why did you use Google Collab 
A. My laptop is very cheap, and Google Collab worked great for what I needed to do.

Q. What are the limitations of SSA 
A. SSA is meant for time series datasets. While it can work with other dependent data sets, it CANNOT be used for datasets with 2 independent variables.
